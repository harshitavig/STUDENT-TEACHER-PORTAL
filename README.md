# STUDENT TEACHER PORTAL 

# Project Overview
This is my first project on Student-Teacher Portal built using MySQL and Power BI. The portal simulates a real-world educational system with role-based access, data integrity checks and analytics dashboards.Key objectives of the project:
-Create a relational database for students, teachers, and courses.
-Implement advanced SQL concepts like triggers and stored procedures.
-Analyze and visualize the data in Power BI.

# Technologies Used:
- SQL – Database creation, queries, triggers, and stored procedures
- Power BI – Dashboard visualization
- Data Modeling – Relationships, primary and foreign keys

# Features
1. Database Design
  - Tables for Students, Teachers, Courses, Enrollments
  - Relationships using Primary & Foreign Keys

2. Advanced SQL
  - Triggers for automated validation
  - Stored Procedures for reusable logic
  - Complex queries to generate meaningful datasets

3. Power BI Dashboard
   - Interactive visualizations for:
   - Student enrollment trends
   - Teacher workload analysis
   - Course-wise performance metrics

# Project Workflow
1. Designed SQL database schema with proper relationships.
2. Populated the database with sample student and teacher data using SQL queries.
3. Implemented triggers and stored procedures to automate validations and processes.
4. Connected the SQL database to Power BI.
5. Built interactive dashboard with charts, slicers, and key metrics.
